# Applied-Time-Series-Project

Founnd very interesting data-set on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city/data) 
containing Uber-trips in NYC. And I'm using this data-set for a time-series analysis project.

#### My goals are to:
> 1) Understand traditional time-series models in detail (such as ARMA,ARIMA,SARIMA etc..)
> 2) Train the model and forecast the #Uber-trips for next 15 days
> 3) Compare the performance of traditional methods with RNN-LSTM.
